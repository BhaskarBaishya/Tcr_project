<h2 style="text-align: center;">OUR STORY</h2>
    <p>The story of your favorite pizza place started back in 2011 when Sanam Kapoor opened his very first pizzeria in his hometown Chandigarh. Inspired by his own search for delicious pizza options, he started to wonder if there was a better way of doing pizza â€“ and business. The last thing the world needed was another pizzeria, but maybe this one could be different. Maybe with this one, everyone could get exactly what they wanted, made fresh on demand. It all started sounding pretty great, and soon Sanam was opening the first La Pinoz in City Beautiful. </p> <br>
